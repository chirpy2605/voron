# Rapid Burner v8

This toolhead for the Voron v0.2 and various [Printers for Ants](https://3dprintersforants.com/).

There are also [Mounts](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/general/Large_Voron_Mounts) available to use this toolhead to the Voron Trident, v2.4, Switchwire and Legacy printers.

It has been specifically designed for the Rapido UHF and Dragon UHF hotends.

The Goliath Air and Goliath Water hotends are also supported.

It uses the standard Voron v0.2 X carriage and also works on both MGN7H and MGN9C rail x-carriages. There's no loss in X, Y or Z.

It supports Nozzle and Logo mounted LED's.

## CFD Analysis:

There is a [document](cfd/) showing the development of the v8 part cooling ducts, describing the CFD analysis and test prints that went into making them.

### Notes:

On the Voron V0, this version only supports the v0.2 X -carriage.

You can also continue to use the [Rapid Burner v4](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Rapid_Burner/Old_Versions/v4) for the v0.1 X -carriage.

### Hotend support:

- Rapido UHF hotend
- Dragon UHF hotend
- Goliath Air
- Goliath Water
- E3D V6 Groove Mount Volcano
- CHC Pro Volcano 115W (Use V6 Groove Mount)

### Extruder support:

- [E3D Roto Vitamins](https://e3d-online.com/pages/help-centre-roto-vitamins) (use the Sherpa Mini hotend mount)
- LGX Lite (use the Sherpa Mini hotend mount)
- Sherpa Mini
- Sherpa Micro
- Sailfin/Sharkfin
- Orbiter v1.5
- Orbiter v2
- Vz-HextrudORT (LGX Lite mount)
- Double Folded Ascender (not for the Goliath Hotend)
- [RoundTrip](https://github.com/waytotheweb/voron/tree/main/general/RoundTrip) (Gears from the LGX Lite, TBG Lite, Orbiter v1.5, Orbiter v2)
- Galileo v2 Standalone (G2SA) with specific mounts for Sherpa Mini and Orbiter v2 mount hole configurations

### Fan support:

- Single 3010 24v hotend cooling fan
- Twin 4010 24v blower part cooling fans
- Screwless hotend fan attachment
- Screwless part cooling fan attachment

**NOTE**: If you use the HoneyBadger 4010 blower fans from Fabreeko you may want to include the following in your klipper config. This is because those fans are slightly out of spec as their vanes protrude from the fan housing and can hit the right X gantry whilst spinning:

- At the top of `[homing_override]` add:

```
    {% set fan_speed_before_homing = printer.fan.speed * 255 %}
    M106 S0
```

- And at the very end of `[homing_override]`

```
    M106 S{fan_speed_before_homing}
```

The cowls support a no probe setup, [SlideSwipe magnetic probe](https://github.com/chestwood96/SlideSwipe), [(Un)Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) and [ZeroClick probe](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroClick)

## Fans:

I am using these fans:

- 24v Axial 3010: [Gdstime](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002857100082.html)
- 24v Blower 4010: [Gdstime](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32799324058.html)

## Heatsink Thermistor:

Each hotend mount includes a hole at the top to insert a thermistor. With this in place, klipper can track the temperature of the heatsink to watch for heat creep from the heatbreak. You can have klipper abort and shutdown before your whole toolhead melts! You only need a simple klipper entry for the appropriate pin on your MCU, e.g.:

```
[temperature_sensor Heatsink]
sensor_type: Generic 3950
sensor_pin: expander:PA5
max_temp: 85
```

Klipper will shutdown if the top of the heatsink hits 85C. You can use thermal paste to help keep a bulb thermistor in contact with the heatsink and route the wires through the provided groove, then fit the extruder on top to hold it in place.

## Assembly:

![](images/explode.png)

![front](images/front.png)

![front](images/back.png)

## Heat Inserts:

Add 4 heat inserts into the hotend mount. Most hotend mounts accept them from underneath, some need them from the top:

![hotend_mount](images/hotendinserts.png)

## LEDs:

Support has been added for either standard Neopixels or Sequins for the nozzle LEDs, Neopixels, Sequins and RainbowBarf for the Logo LED.

If you do not want to use the Logo LED you can fit the [a]_Carrier_Dummy.STL instead and print an opaque diffuser.

LED's are best cabled in series if they are addressable to allow independent control.

There are 2 soldering jigs included in the repo, one for Neopixels and one for Sequins. They should help with soldering the wires for the nozzle lights with the correct gap space and can be used for the Logo LED as well.

The following is one solution to wiring the LEDs. There are a myriad of others, but this works relatively easily:

![](images/ledleft.png)

![](images/ledright.png)

# 

### Logo LED:

![](images/logofitted.png)

You need to print the [c]*Diffuser.stl out of a transparent/translucent filament, such as natural ABS. You then will need to print the [o]_Carrier*[led type].stl of choice in an opaque filament to help prevent light bleed. The filament used to print the Cowl will likely be fine.

The LED is inserted into the side of the carrier. The diffuser sits inside the front of the carrier:

![](images/logoled.png)

The logo unit is pushed into the cowl from the rear:

![](images/logofitting.png)

### Nozzle Neopixels:

Fit the neopixels into the neopixel carrier and then slot into the cowl being careful not to pinch any wires:

![](images/ledfitting.png)

### Nozzle Sequins & Neopixel Sequins:

Fit the sequins into the sequin carrier and then slot into the cowl being careful not to pinch any wires:![](images/sequin.png)

### LED Software:

To configure the Neopixels in Klipper, I'd suggest using the [GitHub - julianschill/klipper-led_effect: LED effects plugin for klipper](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect).

## Fans:

Insert the fans. You will need to release the cable from the tabs on the front-end 3010 fan as well as the left part cooling 4010 fan. This is to allow the cable to be routed correctly. Care should be taken with the cables after doing this as too much movement could break off the wires from the fans. You can add cable relief with a dab of hot glue on the fan wire connections under the sticker.

Fit the 3010 fan by passing the connector and cable through the provided hole on the right and along the outer channel. The 4010 fans will hold the wires in place in the channels:

![cowl_back](images/cowl.png)

The 3010 hotend fan is meant to slide up from the bottom of the cowl and is friction fit in place. Once the toolhead is fully built it will be held sturdily in place.

There is also a 2510 fan spacer if you would prefer to use a smaller hotend fan.

Slide the 4010 fans into the cowl from the rear into the provided slots.

To provide more space for cables snip off the screw lugs at the top rear of the 4010 fans. On some makes of fan you can also trim more of the fan shroud if you look at the inside of the fan shroud, e.g. on the GDStime. This can make cable routing easier if you have problems:

![](images/gdstime.png)

The rear brace should be fitted to the rear of the ducts using 2 x M3x6mm screws. These screw into plastic, so only lightly tighten. The screws don't provide the rigidity, the brace does, so no need to tighten much at all. Choose between the straight and the curved brace depending on which will better fit with your hotend. Not all hotend and carriage mounts will support using the rear brace:

![](images/brace.png)

## Mounting:

Mount the hotend to the hotend mount:

![cowl_back](images/hotendmount.png)

Attach the extruder to the extruder specific mount into the hotend mount:

![cowl_back](images/extrudermount.png)

The hotend mount needs to be mounted to the X Carriage using 2x M3x10mm screws:

![cowl_back](images/gantrymount.png)

Offer the cowl to the hotend mount and from the front use 2 M3x10mm screws to secure the cowl and the hotend mount together:

![](images/cowlmount.png)

![](images/cowlmountback.png)

Zip-tie the wires at the back of the assembly.

Be careful not to catch any wires between the surfaces and that when the toolhead moves the X and Y axis endstops are triggered (if using physical X/Y endstops). Also check that the X axis can move completely to the left and right.

Plugin, test the fans and redo your Z offset as it will have changed.

## Goliath Air / Water:

![](images/goliathairfront.png)

![](images/goliathwaterfront.png)

This hotend needs some specific instructions that don't apply to the other hotends supported by Rapid Burner.

To be able to fit the nichrome heater wires need to be bent in a specific way to fit into the restricted space of the cowl. This is how I've done it on the Goliath Air:

![](images/goliathheaterwires.jpg)

The wires have been twisted around the hotend following their natural angle of twist. They're then twisted back on themselves and the end of the wires coming out of the shrink-wrapper section are attached to the cowl at the lower zip tie.

Twisting the nichrome wires puts stress on them. You should try and avoid twisted them too often as they could break! You have been warned!

Make sure that the nichrome wire does not touch any part of the cowl, otherwise it will likely melt it almost immediately.

Remember to leave space to push the sock onto the heater section.

The Goliath cowls have their own carriages for the logo LED. The nozzle LED's use the standard ones from the standard Rapid Burner.

You will likely need to unscrew the hotend from the heatbreak and rotate it to get the orientation as in the picture above.

You will need to preload the M3 screws into the hotend mount for screwing onto the X carriage before screwing the hotend to the hotend mount, otherwise the screw heads will not be able to pass the hotend to the holes.
