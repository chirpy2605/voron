# Dragon Burner v8

This is a toolhead for the v0.2 Voron printer. It will also work on the various [Printers for Ants](https://3dprintersforants.com/).

There are also [Mounts](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/general/Large_Voron_Mounts) available to use this toolhead to the Voron Trident, v2.4, Switchwire and Legacy printers.

This toolhead improves the cooling of the hotend and provides much improved part cooling when printing filament that needs it (e.g. PLA). Designed to use 2 4010 blower fans for part cooling and a 3010 fan for hotend cooling.

It supports Nozzle and Logo mounted LED's.

## Review by Maple Leaf Makers:

[Voron Mod Showcase: Dragon Burner Toolhead - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooU3U1dBz1Q) (Dragon Burner v6).

## CFD Analysis:

There is a [document](cfd/) showing the development of the v8 part cooling ducts, describing the CFD analysis and test prints that went into making them.

## Notes:

On the Voron V0, this version only supports the v0.2 X -carriage.

You can also continue to use the [Dragon Burner v4](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner/Old_Versions/v4) for the v0.1 X -carriage.

### Hotend support:

- Dragon SF and HF

**NOTE**: If you use the HoneyBadger 4010 blower fans from Fabreeko you may want to include the following in your klipper config. This is because those fans are slightly out of spec as their vanes protrude from the fan housing and can hit the right X gantry whilst spinning:

- At the top of `[homing_override]` add:

```
    {% set fan_speed_before_homing = printer.fan.speed * 255 %}
    M106 S0
```

- And at the very end of `[homing_override]`

```
    M106 S{fan_speed_before_homing}
```

The cowls support a no probe setup, [SlideSwipe magnetic probe](https://github.com/chestwood96/SlideSwipe), [(Un)Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) and [ZeroClick probe](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroClick)

## Fans:

I am using and can recommend these fans:

- 24v Axial 3010: [Gdstime](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002857100082.html)
- 24v Blower 4010: [Gdstime](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32799324058.html)

## Heatsink Thermistor:

Each hotend mount includes a hole at the top to insert a thermistor. With this in place, klipper can track the temperature of the heatsink to watch for heat creep from the heatbreak. You can have klipper abort and shutdown before your whole toolhead melts! You only need a simple klipper entry for the appropriate pin on your MCU, e.g.:

```
[temperature_sensor Heatsink]
sensor_type: Generic 3950
sensor_pin: expander:PA5
max_temp: 85
```

Klipper will shutdown if the top of the heatsink hits 85C. You can use thermal paste to help keep a bulb thermistor in contact with the heatsink and route the wires through the provided groove, then fit the extruder on top to hold it in place.

## Assembly:

![](images/explode.png)

![front](images/front.png)

![back](images/back.png)

## Heat Inserts:

Add heat inserts into the hotend mount. Most mounts accept them from underneath, some need them from the top:

![hotendinserts](images/hotendinserts.png)

Add heat inserts to the inside of the cowl at the top for the extruder mount to screw in to:

![](images/cowlinserts.png)

## LEDs:

Support has been added for either standard Neopixels or Sequins for the nozzle LEDs, Neopixels, Sequins and RainbowBarf for the Logo LED.

If you do not want to use the Logo LED you can fit the [a]_Carrier_Dummy.STL instead and print an opaque diffuser.

LED's are best cabled in series if they are addressable to allow independent control.

There are 2 soldering jigs included in the repo, one for Neopixels and one for Sequins. They should help with soldering the wires for the nozzle lights with the correct gap space and can be used for the Logo LED as well.

The following is one solution to wiring the LEDs. There are a myriad of others, but this works relatively easily:

![](images/ledleft.png)

![](images/ledright.png)

### Logo LED:

![](images/logofitted.png)

You need to print the [c]_Diffuser.stl out of a transparent/translucent filament, such as natural ABS. You then will need to print the [o]_Carrier_[led type].stl of choice in an opaque filament to help prevent light bleed. The filament used to print the Cowl will likely be fine.

The LED is inserted into the side of the carrier. The diffuser sits inside the front of the carrier:

![](images/logoled.png)

The logo unit is pushed into the cowl from the rear:

![](images/logofitting.png)

### Nozzle Neopixels:

Fit the Neopixels into the neopixel carrier and then slot into the cowl being careful not to pinch any wires:

![](images/ledfitting.png)

### Nozzle Sequins & Neopixel Sequins:

Fit the sequins into the sequin carrier and then slot into the cowl being careful not to pinch any wires:

![](images/sequin.png)

### LED Software:

To configure the Neopixels in Klipper, I'd suggest using the [[GitHub - julianschill/klipper-led_effect: LED effects plugin for klipper](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect).

## Fans:

Insert the fans. You will need to release the cable from the tabs on the front-end 3010 fan as well as the left part cooling 4010 fan. This is to allow the cable to be routed correctly. Care should be taken with the cables after doing this as too much movement could break off the wires from the fans. You can add cable relief with a dab of hot glue on the fan wire connections under the sticker.

Fit the 3010 fan by passing the connector and cable through the provided hole on the right and along the outer channel. The 4010 fans will hold the wires in place in the channels:

![cowl](images/cowl.png)

The 3010 hotend fan is meant to slide up from the bottom of the cowl and is friction fit in place. Once the toolhead is fully built it will be held sturdily in place.

There is also a 2510 fan spacer if you would prefer to use a smaller hotend fan.

Slide the 4010 fans into the cowl from the rear into the provided slots.

To provide more space for cables snip off the screw lugs at the top rear of the 4010 fans. On some makes of fan you can also trim more of the fan shroud if you look at the inside of the fan shroud, e.g. on the GDStime. This can make cable routing easier if you have problems:

![](images/gdstime.png)

Attach the hotend to the hotend specific mount:

![hotendmount](images/hotendmount.png)

Attach the extruder to the extruder specific mount into the hotend mount:

![extrudermount](images/extrudermount.png)

Mount the extruder to the hotend mount and slide the assembly onto the cowl taking care to fit the 4010 part cooling fans into the slots:

![](images/mountedback.png)

![mountedfront](images/mountedfront.png)

Next, screw the extruder mount to the cowl using 2 x M3x20mm screws (not available for all extruders). Do _not_ overtighten these screws or the PTFE tube could be deformed:

![](images/extrudercowl.png)

The rear brace should be fitted to the rear of the ducts using 2 x M3x6mm screws. These screw into plastic, so only lightly tighten. The screws don't provide the rigidity, the brace does, so no need to tighten much at all. Choose between the straight and the curved brace depending on which will better fit with your hotend. Not all hotend and carriage mounts will support using the rear brace:

![](images/brace.png)

Zip-tie the wires at the back of the assembly, ensuring the wires do not foul the X carriage.

Offer up the toolhead assembly to the X carriage and secure using 2 M3x35mm screws. Be careful not to catch any wires between any of the surfaces.

![](images/gantryfront.png)

![](images/gantryback.png)

Check that when the toolhead moves, the X and Y axis end stops are triggered if you use them (e.g. on the stock v0.1).

On the v0.2 X carriage you can use a 20mm screw from the rear of the carriage into the corresponding  m3 nut inside the toolhead.

Plugin, test the fans and redo your Z offset as it will have changed.

## PCB Mounts:

Mounts for various extruders and PCB mounts are [available](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/general/PCB_Mounts).

## Alternative Mounts:

[Mounts are available](../../general/Alternative_Voron_Mounts) for all the Voron printers as well as Tap and Boop.
